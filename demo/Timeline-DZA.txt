# text.alpha = 0: suppress data labels in the graph

# collapse: collapse all rows into a single row.

# stagger: stagger the text on the plot so that it falls from the top of each bar to the bottom.
# possible, but silly, to use this in combination with text.alpha = 0
> timeline(dza, stagger=TRUE)
